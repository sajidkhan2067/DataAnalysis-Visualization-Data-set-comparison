## Project Overview

The project focuses on visualizing key features in datasets using box plots, specifically highlighting flow characteristics measured by CICFlowMeter. Flows in network traffic represent sequences of related data packets with common attributes like IP addresses, port numbers, and transport protocols. The README includes figures depicting total packets transmitted in both forward and backward directions, along with an overview of the overall volume of packet traffic in the datasets.

Additionally, a figure provides insights into the average packet size by illustrating the mean value of the total packet length. The box plots reveal similar distributions between attack and benign traffic in the generated datasets, presenting challenges for rule-based detection models. The overlapping distributions underscore the complexity of accurately classifying attacks, necessitating the development of advanced detection techniques to combat emerging threats.
